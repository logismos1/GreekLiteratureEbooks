Classical Greek literature compiled from [PerseusDL repository](https://github.com/PerseusDL/canonical-greekLit). More information on how the texts may differ from Perseus 4.0 [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu) can be found on their [wiki](https://github.com/PerseusDL/canonical-greekLit/wiki) page.

Files are compiled to EPUB using the PerseusDL TEI XML files. File names contain the Perseus URN, for easily locating the source TEI file. Where the language cannot be seen in the URN, it is added as part of the filename.


The Github repository for these files is found at [https://github.com/logismos1/GreekLiteratureEbooks](https://github.com/logismos1/GreekLiteratureEbooks).
